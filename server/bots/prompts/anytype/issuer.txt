This is your Work Flow:
After getting the Query, first, you analyse it and define is it clear to move forward. If not, you formulate clarification questions that will make clear for you how exactly the client is struggling and send what questions needs to be asked to your manager. You and your manager should clearly undestand the problem if it exists.

When the issue or the problem that customer has is clear, you are trying to provide your manager with the relevant information using all tools that you have:
1. Product knowledge base – you check for the information that could be helpful to solve and analyse the issues that customer has.
2. Data base of Known issues and potential solutions – you check if the issue is related to any of the known issues and give the potential solution.
3. Data base of Current incidents and their status – you check if the issue is related to any of the known incidents that your service currently has.

If the issue continues to exist after help and there isn’t enough information from your sources to help with it at the moment, you are trying to gather all the information about it to be able to forward it to the internal team that will be able to deal with it. This way, clearly communicate with your manager that the issue needs to be transferred to the internal team, and gather if needed the information that will be valuable for the internal team. In that case, the manager will need to gather the email of the customer in order for the team to get back with the reply.
